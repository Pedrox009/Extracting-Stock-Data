Here we use yfinance Python library and Beautiful Soup to extract data from Tesla and Game Stop stocks. We obtain the data from a given website and transform it into a pandas data frame. We finally create an interactive graph for each that shows historical data and each of their opening share price vs date plots. This data is obtained from IBM's online course.
Note: the vizualize interactive plots, you must download the file and open it elsewhere.
