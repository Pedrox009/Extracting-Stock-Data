# Projects
Previous projects completed during my undergraduate course and more current ones

This project showcases a series of statistical techniques applied to physical data sets in a physics context. It involves computing statistical parameters, generating probability distributions, and comparing linear vs. quadratic data fits â€” all fundamental skills for data analysis.

This project was conducted as part of an advanced undergraduate physics course and demonstrates applied knowledge in:

Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation)

Normal and Poisson distribution modeling

Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing

Linear and quadratic curve fitting

Residual analysis and F-test comparison

Matrix computation for model fitting using Excel

 Tools & Skills Used
Excel: For statistical calculations, matrix inversion, and plotting

Mathematics: Applied probability theory and statistical modeling

Scientific Reasoning: To interpret confidence intervals and hypothesis outcomes

ðŸ“ˆ Key Outputs
Histogram overlays with fitted Normal and Poisson distributions

CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function) plots

Linear and quadratic regression models with derived equations:

Linear Fit: y = -3.745 + 0.382x

Quadratic Fit: y = -7.759 + 0.493x - 0.00058xÂ²

Residual analysis showing better fit for the quadratic model

Confidence interval calculations for both models

Files
SA.pdf: Full report containing all equations, calculations, plots, and interpretations.
